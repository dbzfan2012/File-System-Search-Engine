Suzuha: "The world line I wish for isn't... what did you call it? The Alpha world line? It's not that."
Suzuha: "What I wish to reach..."
Suzuha: "...is the space between attractor fields."
The... space between?
Suzuha: "There lies a world line not interfered with by any attractor field."
Suzuha: "A world line known as Steins Gate."
Rintaro: "Wha..."
But that's the chuuni name I pulled out of my ass! It doesn't even mean anything!
Suzuha: "I was told that Steins Gate is a brand new world line, one no one has ever observed."
Itaru: "But didn't someone have to observe it to know it's there?"
Suzuha: "Nope. It's never been observed. That's what makes it new."
Suzuha: "But Dad and Uncle Okarin were able to calculate its divergence."
Suzuha: "-0.081609% relative to the current world line."
Suzuha: "That's where we'll find Steins Gate."
