// ======================================
// ====== Comprehension Questions =======
// ======================================
//
// Each of the below questions can be answered in ~20 words (and
// definitely no more than 40).  For reference, the sample solution's
// answers are <20 words.  WE WILL STOP READING IF YOUR ANSWER IS
// >40 WORDS, so keep them concise please :)
//
// 1. What is the difference between "const int *" and "int *const"?
// "const int *" makes it so the integer being pointed to
// is unmutable through this while the pointer variable itself
// is mutable. "int *const" lets you mutate the pointed to
// value, but the pointer itself can be changed.
//
// 2. List one difference between a pointer and a reference.
// Unlike pointers, references do not store any data. Pointers
// store an address to some specified point of data, while
// references are like maps to an existing piece of data.
